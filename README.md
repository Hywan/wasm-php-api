# WebAssembly PHP API

This is a draft, a Work In Progress.

## Design Goals

## Interfaces

The PHP API is implemented as a set of interfaces or abstract classes,
that can be found in the `src/` directory.

The Composer package name is `webassembly/php`. The package isn't yet
publshed on [Packagist](https://packagist.org).
